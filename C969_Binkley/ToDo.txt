B.  Provide the ability to add, update, and delete customer records in the database, including name, address, phone number, city name, and country.

C.   Provide the ability to add, update, and delete appointments, capturing the type of appointment and a link to the specific customer record in the database. 'a link to the specific customer record in the database' is a fancy way of saying customer id. Minimum data for user input should be type, customer, & schedule time.

E.   Provide the ability to automatically adjust appointment times based on user time zones and daylight-saving time. Convert times when inserting into/extracting from the database.

F.   Write exception controls to prevent each of the following. You may use the same mechanism of exception control more than once, but you must incorporate at least two different mechanisms of exception control.
    •   scheduling an appointment outside business hours (Set reasonable business hours 9-5 7 days a week)
    •   scheduling overlapping appointments (ONLY user cannot be in two appts at one time)
    •   entering nonexistent or invalid customer data(blank text)

H.  Write code to provide reminders and alerts 15 minutes in advance of an appointment, based on the user’s log-in. Check all appts for that user, do it only at login, and do not use the 'current time' in the database for this.

I.   Provide the ability to generate each of the following reports:
•   number of appointment types by month - Given a type and a month, how many appts match this? Not a list, a count.
•   the schedule for each user 
•   one additional report of your choice
